software-box
============

This project is my attempt to automate installation of softwares on Windows machines. The project contains some custom DOS scripts to install some of the softwares that are required during software development process. Currently, only Java development environment has been covered by the project. However, the scripts can easily be replicated for any other environment or softwars.
